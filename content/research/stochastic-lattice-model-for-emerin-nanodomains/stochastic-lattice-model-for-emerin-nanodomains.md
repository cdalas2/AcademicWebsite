<p style="font-size: 16px" align="justify">Emerin is a nuclear membrane protein (of mammalian cells) involved in the transduction of membrane mechanical signals between the cytoskeleton and the nucleoskeleton, and is thought to be central to a range of nuclear processes, including those which involve the maintenance of the architecture of the nucleus and its protection against mechanical stress.  Superresolution fluorescence microscopy on the inner nuclear membrane has shown that in steady state, emerin organizes into monomer clusters about 200-300 nanometers in diameter, which envelope many smaller oligomer clusters.</p>
