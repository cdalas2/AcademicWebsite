<p style="font-size: 16px" align="justify">Bacteria motility has been observed for over 300 years. Some bacteria, like <i>Escherichia coli</i> have flagella, which are whip-like appendages, they can rotate in a helical motion such as to produce an anisotropic drag that propels them forward through fluid. In bulk fluid, E. coli performs a two state motion characterized by straight runs punctuated by fast tumbles in which the bacteria slow to a stop and re-orient their swimming direction. In the presence of a chemoattractant or chemorepellant, the bacteria bias their motion via a process known as chemotaxis. In the presence of chemoattractants, the chemoreceptor proteins on the cell membrane activate <i>E. coli</i>'s flagella to swim forward, whereas chemorepellants de-activate chemoreceptors causing <i>E. coli</i> to tumble to swim in a new direction. After many cycles of this kind of motion, <i>E. coli</i> will move towards chemoreceptors or away from chemorepellants.
<br><br>
A few years ago, it was shown that in the absence of chemoattractants and chemorepellants, <i>E. coli</i> thermotaxis to warmer temperatures using some of the same chemoreceptors involved in chemotaxis. Experimental work, previously, measured the dependence on temperature of bilayer material constants and show that lipid bilayers are decrease in thickness and are easier to deform in warmer temperatures. We will present a temperature dependent bilayer mechanical model to argue that <i>E. coli</i>'s thermotactic abilities may be accounted for by protein-bilayer mechanical interactions. Our results look promising, and we are in the process of finalizing our manuscript for submission. We will also be presenting our results at the upcoming APS March Meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada. Stay tuned for updates on progress in our manuscript and video recording of my talk at the annual APS March Meeting.
