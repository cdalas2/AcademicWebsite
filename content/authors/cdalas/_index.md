caption: "Carlos D. Alas studied physics, computer science, biology, and math at the [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/physics), the [California Polytechnic State University of San Luis Obispo](https://physics.calpoly.edu), and the Antelope Valley College, and obtained his PhD at the University of Southern California on the computational and theoretical physics of membranes and membrane proteins (Advisor: [C. A. Haselwandter](https://www.haselwandterlab.com/Contact)), along with a Masters in Computer Science. Dr. Alas has won several awards in academia, including various scholarships, a subject area award in physics, and a DIA Fellowship. After the completion of his doctoral program, Dr. Alas embarked on a career in modeling data at The Travelers Indemnity Company as a Senior Associate Data Scientist. In his spare time, Dr. Alas can be found exploring the greater Los Angeles area, including the [neighboring coastal areas](https://www.visitlagunabeach.com/), [Los Angeles National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/angeles), and billiard halls on occasion. Dr. Alas also enjoys cooking and swimming for his aerobic fitness."
