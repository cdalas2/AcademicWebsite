caption: Carlos D. Alas pursued studies in computational and theoretical physics, computer science, and mathematics at the [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/physics), [California Polytechnic State University of San Luis Obispo](https://physics.calpoly.edu), and [Antelope Valley College](https://www.avc.edu). Dr. Alas earned his doctorate from the University of Southern California, focusing on the physical principles of membrane mechanics, membrane domain formation, and cellular signal transduction under the guidance of Dr. C. A. Haselwandter. Additionally, Dr. Alas holds a Master's in Computer Science. Dr. Alas has garnered many accolades in academia, including several research scholarships, a physics subject area award, and a DIA Fellowship. Beyond the academic realm, Dr. Alas has found success in the dynamic field of data science, currently serving as a Senior Associate Data Scientist at The Travelers Indemnity Company. During his moments of leisure, Dr. Alas enjoys exploring the diverse landscapes of the greater Los Angeles area. Whether soaking up the vibrant [coastal regions](https://www.visitlagunabeach.com), immersing himself in the tranquility of the [Los Angeles National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/angeles), or occasionally indulging in a low stakes game of billiards, Dr. Alas maintains a well-rounded perspective. In addition to his professional and academic pursuits, Dr. Alas finds joy in culinary exploration and maintains a commitment to aerobic fitness through swimming.
